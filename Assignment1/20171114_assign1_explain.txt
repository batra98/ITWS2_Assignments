q1) In Question 1, I have used  cat to display input1.txt, then i piped it to awk. If length of line is >= 35 i have piped it into sed where i replaced "in" with "in fact" i have used \b for excatly same match
it can have 2 solutions 
i. cat input1.txt | awk '{if(length($0)>=35){print $0}}' | sed 's/\bin\b/in fact/g'
ii. cat input1.txt | awk '{if(length($0)>=35){print $0}}' | sed 's/\<in\>/in fact/g'

i have used length which is a inbuilt function in awk.

i am displaying all lines with character count >= 35 with the required replacements

instead of doing "cat" one can also do "awk '{if(length($0)>=35){print $0}}' input1.txt"  




q2) awk '{if($3=="apathy"){$3="g1a2u3r4a5v"};{print $0}}' input2.txt | grep -z "g1a2u3r4a5v" | sed 's/g1a2u3r4a5v/empathy/g'

 In Question 2, I have used awk to replace 3rd "apathy" with "g1a2u3r4a5v". then i use grep to print all lines (the lines with "g1a2u3r4a5v" are highlighted).
then i used sed to replace "g1a2u3r4a5v" with "empathy".


q3) sed 's/./#/5g' input3.txt

 i am using sed to replace characters with #, 5g is used to make changes from 5th character onwards.

q4) cat input4.txt | awk -F ":" '{print "USER #"NR"="$1}'

 i am using ":" as the delimiter and printing the output line by line.
instead of doing "cat" i could have also used "awk -F ":" '{print "USER #"NR"="$1}' input4.txt".

i had also written bash script which is as follows:-

#!/bin/bash
a=`cat input4.txt | awk -F ":" '{print $1}'`

count=1

for i in `echo $a`
do
	echo "USER #$count=$i"
	((count++))
done 

as mentioned in question.

q5) egrep 'TS([- ])..\1(.{1}([5]{3}|[S]{3})|.{2}([5]{2}|[S]{2}))\1[0O]' MostWanted.txt

 input of program is taken from MostWanted.txt.
 i am using regex to pull out the desired output.
 \1 is used to have the same delimiter
